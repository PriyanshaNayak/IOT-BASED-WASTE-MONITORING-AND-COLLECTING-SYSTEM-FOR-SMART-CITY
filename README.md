# IOT-BASED-WASTE-MONITORING-AND-COLLECTING-SYSTEM-FOR-SMART-CITY
The project involves applying IoT technology (electronics and applications) to the current urban waste management scenario and enables two-way communication between the infrastructures that are deployed in the city and also the operators/administrators.

### INTRODUCTION
# BACKGROUND 
Waste management is all the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste together with monitoring and regulation. Waste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by the local government and authorities. Nevertheless, the services rendered are very poor as the execution of these systems is unscientific, old-fashioned, and unorganized. The quantity of waste is littered all over leading to an unhygienic living environment.

Curbside collection is the most common method of disposal in most countries, in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialized trucks. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal area. 

Nowadays, cities with developing economies experience exhausted waste collection services, and inadequately managed and uncontrolled dumpsites, and the problems are worsening. Waste collection methods in such countries are an ongoing challenge and many struggle due to weak institutions and rapid urbanization.

This project IOT based Waste Collection System is a very innovative system that will help to keep the cities clean. The status of the garbage container is notified to the user monitoring it. The location of the filled garbage container can be seen via a Google map that gives a graphical view of the garbage bins and highlights the garbage bin with a marker. The notification is sent via a mobile communication network to the truck driver. The LCD screen shows the status of the garbage level along with the task carried out of the specific garbage bin.

# PROBLEMS 
# Wastage of Resources: 
Since the garbage collectors don't get to know exactly when the dustbins are to be cleaned, they need to regularly monitor them. This consumes a lot of time, effort, and fuel. 

# Unhygienic Environment: 
Overuse of some dustbins results in waste getting littered all around. This causes an extremely unhygienic situation.

# MOTIVATION 
IOT-based Waste Collection System is one of the core components of the modern age hype Smart City. There are countless Smart IoT-based Solutions for waste management systems that are being implemented throughout the globe, in developed and first-world countries to be specific. However, Waste management is also a great problem in poor developing countries as waste is scattered all over roads due to improper methods of collection and dumping thus polluting the environment. Due to a lot of factors including socio-economic and cultural drawbacks existing smart solutions are not compatible in developing countries like Nepal, as there exists basic problems regarding the primary task of waste management like proper disposal, collection, etc..

# OBJECTIVES
The main objective of our project involves applying IoT technology (electronics and applications) to the current urban waste management scenario and enabling two-way communication between the infrastructures that are deployed in the city and also the operators/administrators. A centralized system for real-time monitoring is our goal to achieve. In this way both the municipal and citizens benefit from an optimized system which results in major cost savings and less urban pollution.

# APPLICATIONS 
The project will be applicable for the following purposes:

•It reduces the environmental pollution.

• Real-time based cleaning of the garbage container.

•It can be used in smart cities.

•It empowers clean and green city programs.

•It makes our system transparent between the municipal corporations.

## LITERATURE REVIEW 
The concept of smart bins is not new, it has been in talks for much of the time.In fact it is already being implemented in some parts of the world. Various authors have published their papers regarding smart bins.

In this paper to reduce food waste researchers have proposed an IoT-based smart garbage system to reduce the amount of food waste. In this system battery-based smart garbage bins exchange information with each other using wireless mesh networks, and a router and server collect and analyze the information for service provisioning and include various IoT techniques for user convenience. The proposed SGS had been operated as a pilot project in Gagman district, Seoul, Republic of Korea, for a one year period which showed that the average amount of food waste was reduced by 33% [1].

In this paper, by integrating different sensing and communication technologies real real-time solid waste bin monitoring system was developed. The system consisted of bins with sensor nodes, gateways, and base stations. Sensor nodes measure and transmit waste conditions inside bins at every access, gateways forward data to the base station after receiving, and the base station stores data for further use. The system helped to minimize collection routes and fuel costs [2].

In this paper, the smart waste bins are connected to the internet to obtain the real status information of the start waste bins. The tremendous growth in population in the past few years resulted in more waste disposal. A proper waste management system is required to avoid the spreading of diseases. In this, the smart dustbins are monitored and the decisions are taken as per the status of the bins. The waste bins are placed throughout the city or campus and are interfaced with the microcontroller-based system with IR sensors and RF modules. IR sensor looks for the level of waste in the waste bin and sends the signal to the microcontroller. The same signal is encoded and forwarded to the RF receiver through the RF transmitter. RF receiver receives the signal and decodes it at the central system. An internet connection is enabled through a LAN cable from the modem. That is received, analyzed, and processed in the cloud that displays the Garbage status in the waste bin on the GUI on the web browser [3].

In this paper, a design of an electronic system is proposed in order to give a solution for an improper waste disposal system. It comprises the use of a biosensor sensor and weight sensor along with a height sensor to sense the runover of the waste in the waste bin and the intensity of pollution caused by undesired poisonous gases from the waste bins. Afterward, these sensors are fed to the controller to help the GSM module send a notification to the respective authority about the status of the waste bin. The main aim of this paper is to provide a solution for the proper disposal of waste. An effective waste management system is achieved through the use of the sensors in this paper where sensor units are used for sensing, a microcontroller for controlling and a GSM module for communication, and solar energy is used for the power necessary in the operating system [4].

In this paper, the real-time waste management system has been implemented by the use of smart dustbins to look for the filled level of dustbins to know if the dustbins are overflowing or not. The concerned person can access the information of all the smart dustbins anytime and anywhere and thus, decisions can be taken in accordance with that. Goals like reduction in cost, resource optimization, and effective usage of smart dustbins can be achieved by implementing this proposed system. An indirect reduction in the traffic of the system can be done with the help of this system as in the cities, the garbage collection vehicle is been sent to the area each day twice or thrice depending upon the respective population there and sometimes the dustbins may not be full. The concerned authority will have to send the garbage collection vehicle only when the dustbins are full as the proposed system will inform the real-time status of each dustbin in real time [5].

In this paper, to reduce the costs of waste management, and to facilitate automation of the waste identification and weight quantity process, radio frequency identification (RFID) and load sensors are used for designing smart waste management systems. Waste management is the basic essential for a healthy environment for above two hundred municipalities in Australia, the highest waste generators in the world (OECD 2002). Australia comes under the top 10 household waste producers in the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. Australia produces waste at the rate of 2.25 Kilograms per person per day. Over 17 million tonnes of waste was disposed in landfills in Australia during 2002-03. Municipalities' waste contributed more than 30% to it. Australian households produced almost 95% recycled waste and around 83% re-used waste in March 2003. Also, more than 1.3 million tonnes of plastic is produced by Australians every year exceeding 71 Kg per person.  Around 485000 tonnes of steel cans were recycled in Australia in 2002. That is enough steel to rebuild the Sydney Harbour Bridge almost 4 times. Approximately, 57 sheets of toilet paper are used per person in a day. Waste disposal is a key environmental concern, principally in urban centers in Australia [6].

In this paper, by integrating different sensing and communication technologies real-time solid waste bin monitoring system was developed. The system consisted of bins with sensor nodes, gateways, and base stations. Sensor nodes measure and transmit waste conditions inside bins at every access, gateways forward data to the base station after receiving, and the base station stores data for further use. The system helped to minimize collection routes and fuel costs [7].

## SOFTWARE TOOLS USED: 
# Arduino IDE 
The Arduino IDE is a cross-platform application (for Windows, macOS, Linux) that is written in the programming language Java. It is used to write and upload programs to the Arduino board.

The source code for the IDE is released under the GNU General Public License, version 2. The Arduino IDE supports the languages C and C++ using special rules of code structuring. The Arduino IDE supplies a software library from the Wiring project, which provides many common input and output procedures. User-written code only requires two basic functions, for starting the sketch and the main program loop, which is compiled and linked with a program stub main into an executable cyclic executive program with the GNU toolchain, also included with the IDE distribution. The Arduino IDE employs the program Avrdude to convert the executable code into a text file in hexadecimal encoding that is loaded into the Arduino board by a loader program in the board’s firmware.

# Proteus 
The Proteus Design Suite is a proprietary software tool suite used primarily for electronic design automation. The software is used mainly by electronic engineers and also technicians to create schematics and electronic prints for manufacturing printed circuit boards.

It was developed in Yorkshire, England by Lab Center Electronics Ltd and is available in English, French, Spanish, and Chinese languages. Even if u are not using it for PCB designing you can view the PCB layout of the component individually selecting components it helps during the soldering of components in PCB. Proteus is ahead in simulating the circuits containing the microcontrollers where we can simulate the circuit by uploading the hex code to the Microcontroller.

## HARDWARE TOOLS USED: 
# Ultrasonic Sensor HC SR04
A special sonic transducer is used for the ultrasonic proximity sensors, which allows for alternate transmission and reception of sound waves. The sonic waves emitted by the transducer are reflected by an object and received back in the transducer. After having emitted the sound waves, the ultrasonic sensor will switch to receive mode. The time elapsed between emitting and receiving is proportional to the distance of the object from the sensor. Ultrasonic sensors generate high-frequency sound waves and evaluate the echo that is received back by the sensor, measuring the time interval between sending the signal and receiving the echo to determine the distance to an object.

# GSM Module

GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications, originally Groupe Special Mobile), is a standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the protocols for second-generation (2G) digital and Cellular networks used by mobile phones, first deployed in Finland in July 1991. As of 2014, it has become the default global standard for mobile communications – with over 90% market share, operating in over 219 countries and territories. 

GSM is a mobile communication modem; it stands for global system for mobile communication (GSM). The idea of GSM was developed at Bell Laboratories in 1970.  It is a widely used mobile communication system in the world. GSM is an open and digital cellular technology used for transmitting mobile voice and data services operating at the 850MHz, 900MHz, 1800MHz, and 1900MHz frequency bands. GSM system was developed as a digital system using the time division multiple access (TDMA) technique for communication purposes. A GSM digitizes and reduces the data, then sends it down through a channel with two different streams of client data, each in its particular time slot. The digital system can carry 64 kbps to 120 Mbps of data rates.

SIM900 is a complete Quad-band GSM/GPRS solution in an SMT type that can be embedded in customer applications.

SIM900 supports Quad-band 850/900/1800/1900MHz, it can transmit Voice, SMS, and data information with low power consumption. With a tiny size of 24*24*3mm, it can fit into the slim and compact demands of customer design. Featuring Bluetooth and Embedded AT, it allows total cost savings and fast time-to-market for customer applications.

                                           (GSM Module Sim 900)

GSM networks operate in many different carrier frequency ranges (separated into GSM frequency ranges for 2G and UMTS.

Frequency bands for 3G), with most 2G GSM networks operating in the 900 MHz or 1800 MHz bands. Where these bands were already allocated, the 850 MHz and 1900 MHz bands were used instead (for example in Canada and the United States). In rare cases, the 400 and 450 MHz frequency bands are assigned in some countries because they were previously used for first-generation systems.

# 16*2 LCD

LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen is an electronic display module and find a wide range of applications. A 16×2 LCD is a very basic module and is very commonly used in various devices and circuits. These modules are preferred over seven segments and other multi-segment LEDs. The reasons are: that LCDs are economical; easily programmable; and have no limitation of displaying special & even custom characters (unlike in seven segments), animations, and so on.

A 16×2 LCD means it can display 16 characters per line and there are 2 such lines. In this LCD each character is displayed in a 5×7 pixel matrix. This LCD has two registers, namely, Command and Data.

The command register stores the command instructions given to the LCD. A command is an instruction given to an LCD to do a predefined task like initializing it, clearing its screen, setting the cursor position, controlling the display, etc. The data register stores the data to be displayed on the LCD. The data is the ASCII value of the character to be displayed on the LCD.

# SIM CARD

A subscriber identity module or subscriber identification module(SIM) is an integrated circuit that is intended to securely store the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers on mobile telephony devices (such as mobile phones and computers). It is also possible to store contact information on many SIM cards. SIM cards are always used on GSM phones; CDMA phones, are only needed for newer LTE-capable handsets. SIM cards can also be used in satellite phones, computers, or cameras.

A SIM card contains its unique serial number (ICCID), international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number, security authentication, and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to, and two passwords: a personal identification number (PIN) for ordinary use, and a personal unblocking code (PUC) for PIN unlocking.

SIM cards store network-specific information used to authenticate and identify subscribers on the network. The most important of these are the ICCID, IMSI, Authentication Key (Ki), Local Area Identity (LAI), and Operator-Specific Emergency Number. The SIM also stores other carrier-specific data such as the SMSC (Short Message Service Center) number, Service Provider Name (SPN), Service Dialing Numbers (SDN), Advice-Of-Charge parameters, and Value Added Service (VAS) applications.

# USB TO SERIAL BOARD.

Using this module, any of the serial UART sockets on a mainboard can be converted into a virtual serial connection over USB. Use this connection to transfer data to a PC or for debugging over serial (virtual serial over USB). This is useful when needing to free up the USB client port for other purposes, like simulating a mouse or keyboard on the USB Client port.

A USB-to-serial converter consists of a USB serial processor chip, and a serial driver chip and if the adapter is isolated there will be optocouplers in front of the USB and/or serial ports. The design consists of an FT232 USB serial processor from FTDI, which is a dual serial port processor. This processor is combined with an SP213 high-speed RS232 transceiver which makes the overall performance of the adapter solid and reliable.

# BREADBOARD 

# JUMPER WIRES

## BACKGROUND THEORY 

# Arduino

Arduino is an open-source project that created microcontroller-based kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control physical devices.

# Overview

Arduino is an open-source hardware and software project, created with a simple aim in mind, to be as simple as possible. Arduino can sense the environment by receiving input from a variety of sensors and can affect its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators. The microcontroller on the board is programmed using the Arduino programming language and the Arduino development environment. Arduino projects can be stand-alone or they can communicate with software running on a computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP.

# Features

# Digital Pins:  
In addition to the specific functions listed below, the digital pins on an Arduino board can be used for general-purpose input and output via the pinMode(), digitalRead(), and digitalWrite()commands. Each pin has an internal pull-up resistor which can be turned on and off using digitalWrite() (w/ a value of HIGH or LOW, respectively) when the pin is configured as an input. The maximum current per pin is 40 mA.

# Serial: 0 (RX) and 1 (TX) : 
Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. On the Arduino Diecimila, these pins are connected to the corresponding pins of the FTDI USB-to-TTL Serial chip. On the Arduino BT, they are connected to the corresponding pins of the WT11 Bluetooth module. The Arduino Mini and LilyPad Arduino, are intended for use with an external TTL serial module (e.g. the Mini-USB Adapter).

# External Interrupts: 2 and 3 :
These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value. See the attachInterrupt() function for details.

# PWM: 
Pin numbers 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function. On boards with an ATmega8, PWM output is available only on pins 9, 10, and 11.

# BT Reset: 7. (Arduino BT-only) :
Connected to the reset line of the bluetooth module.

# SPI: 
These pins support SPI communication, which, although provided by the underlying hardware, is not currently included in the Arduino language.

# Analog Pins: 
Most of the analog inputs can also be used as digital pins: analog input 0 as digital pin 14 through analog input 5 as digital pin 19. Analog inputs 6 and 7 (present on the Mini and BT) cannot be used as digital pins.

# I2C:4(SDA) and 5(SCL) : 
Support I2C (TWI) communication using the Wire library (documentation on the Wiring website).

# Power Pins: VIN (sometimes labeled “9V”) :
The input voltage to the Arduino board when it’s using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or other regulated power source) 5V. The regulated power supply used to power the microcontroller and other components on the board. This can come either from VIN via an on-board regulator, or be supplied by USB or another regulated 5V supply. 

## SYSTEM DESIGN

(Block Diagram of IOT-Based Waste Collection System For SmartCity)

The overall system is controlled by an AT MEGA 328p microcontroller. It executes programs to control other devices or modules as in this project. The MC is supplied with a 5v controlled power supply. Arduino UNO is the main Module in this project. The Ultrasonic sensor is interfaced with Arduino UNO to check the level of garbage filled in the dustbin. GSM/GPRS Module is used to establish communication between a user computer and a GSM-GPRS system and using this module we get the SMS notification from the trashcan. GPS Module is a navigation device that will indicate the location where garbage is filled and by using the GSM Module we get a unique IP address for SMS and also Municipal Officer can see the garbage bin status on the website. The LCD interfaced with the Arduino indicates the garbage level in a trashcan. Then immediately message is immediately transferred to the Municipal Wed Server Office. The location marker on the webpage displays the dustbin status or information on the webpage in real time. The message is sent via the GSM-GPRS module along with the exact location link to the truck driver. The driver can see the location of the bin via a webpage.

# Algorithm :

       1. Start.

       2. Check the value from the Ultrasonic sensor.

       3. Update the status of the dustbin on the LCD Screen.

       4. If the Sensor value>Threshold Value, the location is detected.

           Else go to step 2.

       5. Send an SMS to the truck driver via the GSM module with GPS location.

       6. Empty the dustbin and then go to step 2.

       7. Stop.

(Flowchart of IOT-based Waste Management System)

This project IOT based Waste Collection System is a very innovative system that will help to keep the cities clean. Initially, GSM, GPS, and the LCD are initialized. The level of the garbage container is sensed by the garbage container. If the sensor value is greater than the threshold value. The location of the garbage container is tracked by the GPS module. If not the ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors the level of garbage. The real-time information about the garbage bin can be viewed in the garbage container on the LCD. The information is displayed in terms of percentage. The status of the garbage container is notified to the user monitoring it. The notification is sent to the truck driver via an SMS through the GSM module.

The message contains the link to the Google map and the link provides the exact location of where the dustbin is filled. The location of the filled garbage container can be seen via a Google map that gives a graphical view of the garbage bins and highlights the garbage bin with a marker and further the process is repeated.

## IMPLEMENTATION

# Circuit Design :

Every electronic device requires a rigid circuit to perform its specific task. After successfully simulating the design, the final circuit layout of our system is shown below:-

![image](https://github.com/PriyanshaNayak/IOT-BASED-WASTE-MONITORING-AND-COLLECTING-SYSTEM-FOR-SMART-CITY/assets/87187181/f0b9a898-effb-44ff-a15f-9a975e086c3d)
(Circuit Diagram of the system)

It describes the steps to be followed to implement the proposed system and the hardware components required. In this project of IoT a garbage Collection System, we will be using an ultrasonic range sensor to know the amount of garbage collected in garbage containers and this data is sent through the GSM/GPRS 900A module to the Authorized phone number present at waste management centers. To control this operation, we will be using the ATmega328P microcontroller. The Authorized number present at the Waste Collection Center will receive an SMS which is sent through the GSM/GPRS module and shows fill levels of each garbage bin in real-time on the phone screen.  Secondly, the ultrasonic sensor which is fixed at the dustbin senses the status of the container, this information is collected by the microcontroller (here ATmega328) and displayed on LCD Screen. Thus preventing the garbage on open streets. Most of the time even if the dustbin is not filled it may start stinking which may lead to an irresistible smell in the locality/city

Once this SMS is received, the dustbin is addressed via GPS Module where the driver can find the exact address of the filled container. Thus the locality/city is saved from pollution.

(Plot of the percentage of empty space in a bin over time)

Finally, on performing all the required procedures, we were able to implement our project on an “IOT Based Garbage Monitoring System”. The final output of our project is as follows:-

1. Waste level detection inside the dustbin.
2. Transmit the information wirelessly to the concern.
3. The data can be accessed at any time and from anywhere.
4. real-time data transmission and access.
  
Avoids the overflow of the dustbin. This IoT beached waste management is very useful for smart cities in diverse aspects. We have seen that in cities, there are dissimilar dustbins located in different areas, and dustbins become overflown many times and the concerned people do not get info about this. Our system is designed to crack this issue and will offer complete details of the dustbins located in different areas throughout the city. The allocated authority can access the information from anywhere and anytime to get the details. Accordingly, they can revenue the decision on this immediately.

# Societal Impact : 
• Our system can be used on a larger scale to keep our cities clean by monitoring the garbage in dustbins located in different corners of the city. This would solve to a great extent the sanitary and resource wastage problems mentioned earlier. 
• Besides, a much cleaner city would result in curbing a lot of diseases leading to much better health conditions.
