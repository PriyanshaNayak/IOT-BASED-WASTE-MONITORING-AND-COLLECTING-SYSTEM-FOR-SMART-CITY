# IOT-BASED-WASTE-MONITORING-AND-COLLECTING-SYSTEM-FOR-SMART-CITY
The project involves applying IoT technology (electronics and applications) to the current urban waste management scenario and enables two-way communication between the infrastructures that are deployed in the city and also the operators/administrators.

### INTRODUCTION
# BACKGROUND 
Waste management is all the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste together with monitoring and regulation. Waste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by the local government and authorities. Nevertheless, the services rendered are very poor as the execution of these systems is unscientific, old-fashioned, and unorganized. The quantity of waste is littered all over leading to an unhygienic living environment.

Curbside collection is the most common method of disposal in most countries, in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialized trucks. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal area. 

Nowadays, cities with developing economies experience exhausted waste collection services, and inadequately managed and uncontrolled dumpsites, and the problems are worsening. Waste collection methods in such countries are an ongoing challenge and many struggle due to weak institutions and rapid urbanization.

This project IOT based Waste Collection System is a very innovative system that will help to keep the cities clean. The status of the garbage container is notified to the user monitoring it. The location of the filled garbage container can be seen via a Google map that gives a graphical view of the garbage bins and highlights the garbage bin with a marker. The notification is sent via a mobile communication network to the truck driver. The LCD screen shows the status of the garbage level along with the task carried out of the specific garbage bin.

# PROBLEMS 
# Wastage of Resources: 
Since the garbage collectors don't get to know exactly when the dustbins are to be cleaned, they need to regularly monitor them. This consumes a lot of time, effort, and fuel. 

# Unhygienic Environment: 
Overuse of some dustbins results in waste getting littered all around. This causes an extremely unhygienic situation.

# MOTIVATION 
IOT-based Waste Collection System is one of the core components of the modern age hype Smart City. There are countless Smart IoT-based Solutions for waste management systems that are being implemented throughout the globe, in developed and first-world countries to be specific. However, Waste management is also a great problem in poor developing countries as waste is scattered all over roads due to improper methods of collection and dumping thus polluting the environment. Due to a lot of factors including socio-economic and cultural drawbacks existing smart solutions are not compatible in developing countries like Nepal, as there exists basic problems regarding the primary task of waste management like proper disposal, collection, etc..

# OBJECTIVES

## LITERATURE REVIEW 
The concept of smart bins is not new, it has been in talks for much of the time.In fact it is already being implemented in some parts of the world. Various authors have published their papers regarding smart bins.

In this paper to reduce food waste researchers have proposed an IoT-based smart garbage system to reduce the amount of food waste. In this system battery-based smart garbage bins exchange information with each other using wireless mesh networks, and a router and server collect and analyze the information for service provisioning and include various IoT techniques for user convenience. The proposed SGS had been operated as a pilot project in Gagman district, Seoul, Republic of Korea, for a one year period which showed that the average amount of food waste was reduced by 33% [1].

In this paper, by integrating different sensing and communication technologies real real-time solid waste bin monitoring system was developed. The system consisted of bins with sensor nodes, gateways, and base stations. Sensor nodes measure and transmit waste conditions inside bins at every access, gateways forward data to the base station after receiving, and the base station stores data for further use. The system helped to minimize collection routes and fuel costs [2].

In this paper, the smart waste bins are connected to the internet to obtain the real status information of the start waste bins. The tremendous growth in population in the past few years resulted in more waste disposal. A proper waste management system is required to avoid the spreading of diseases. In this, the smart dustbins are monitored and the decisions are taken as per the status of the bins. The waste bins are placed throughout the city or campus and are interfaced with the microcontroller-based system with IR sensors and RF modules. IR sensor looks for the level of waste in the waste bin and sends the signal to the microcontroller. The same signal is encoded and forwarded to the RF receiver through the RF transmitter. RF receiver receives the signal and decodes it at the central system. An internet connection is enabled through a LAN cable from the modem. That is received, analyzed, and processed in the cloud that displays the Garbage status in the waste bin on the GUI on the web browser [3].

In this paper, a design of an electronic system is proposed in order to give a solution for an improper waste disposal system. It comprises the use of a biosensor sensor and weight sensor along with a height sensor to sense the runover of the waste in the waste bin and the intensity of pollution caused by undesired poisonous gases from the waste bins. Afterward, these sensors are fed to the controller to help the GSM module send a notification to the respective authority about the status of the waste bin. The main aim of this paper is to provide a solution for the proper disposal of waste. An effective waste management system is achieved through the use of the sensors in this paper where sensor units are used for sensing, a microcontroller for controlling and a GSM module for communication, and solar energy is used for the power necessary in the operating system [4].

In this paper, the real-time waste management system has been implemented by the use of smart dustbins to look for the filled level of dustbins to know if the dustbins are overflowing or not. The concerned person can access the information of all the smart dustbins anytime and anywhere and thus, decisions can be taken in accordance with that. Goals like reduction in cost, resource optimization, and effective usage of smart dustbins can be achieved by implementing this proposed system. An indirect reduction in the traffic of the system can be done with the help of this system as in the cities, the garbage collection vehicle is been sent to the area each day twice or thrice depending upon the respective population there and sometimes the dustbins may not be full. The concerned authority will have to send the garbage collection vehicle only when the dustbins are full as the proposed system will inform the real-time status of each dustbin in real time [5].

In this paper, to reduce the costs of waste management, and to facilitate automation of the waste identification and weight quantity process, radio frequency identification (RFID) and load sensors are used for designing smart waste management systems. Waste management is the basic essential for a healthy environment for above two hundred municipalities in Australia, the highest waste generators in the world (OECD 2002). Australia comes under the top 10 household waste producers in the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. Australia produces waste at the rate of 2.25 Kilograms per person per day. Over 17 million tonnes of waste was disposed in landfills in Australia during 2002-03. Municipalities' waste contributed more than 30% to it. Australian households produced almost 95% recycled waste and around 83% re-used waste in March 2003. Also, more than 1.3 million tonnes of plastic is produced by Australians every year exceeding 71 Kg per person.  Around 485000 tonnes of steel cans were recycled in Australia in 2002. That is enough steel to rebuild the Sydney Harbour Bridge almost 4 times. Approximately, 57 sheets of toilet paper are used per person in a day. Waste disposal is a key environmental concern, principally in urban centers in Australia [6].

In this paper, by integrating different sensing and communication technologies real-time solid waste bin monitoring system was developed. The system consisted of bins with sensor nodes, gateways, and base stations. Sensor nodes measure and transmit waste conditions inside bins at every access, gateways forward data to the base station after receiving, and the base station stores data for further use. The system helped to minimize collection routes and fuel costs [7].

## SOFTWARE TOOLS USED: 
# Arduino IDE 
The Arduino IDE is a cross-platform application (for Windows, macOS, Linux) that is written in the programming language Java. It is used to write and upload programs to the Arduino board.

The source code for the IDE is released under the GNU General Public License, version 2. The Arduino IDE supports the languages C and C++ using special rules of code structuring. The Arduino IDE supplies a software library from the Wiring project, which provides many common input and output procedures. User-written code only requires two basic functions, for starting the sketch and the main program loop, which is compiled and linked with a program stub main into an executable cyclic executive program with the GNU toolchain, also included with the IDE distribution. The Arduino IDE employs the program Avrdude to convert the executable code into a text file in hexadecimal encoding that is loaded into the Arduino board by a loader program in the board’s firmware.

# Proteus 
The Proteus Design Suite is a proprietary software tool suite used primarily for electronic design automation. The software is used mainly by electronic engineers and also technicians to create schematics and electronic prints for manufacturing printed circuit boards.

It was developed in Yorkshire, England by Lab Center Electronics Ltd and is available in English, French, Spanish, and Chinese languages. Even if u are not using it for PCB designing you can view the PCB layout of the component individually selecting components it helps during the soldering of components in PCB. Proteus is ahead in simulating the circuits containing the microcontrollers where we can simulate the circuit by uploading the hex code to the Microcontroller.

## HARDWARE TOOLS USED: 
# Ultrasonic Sensor HC SR04
A special sonic transducer is used for the ultrasonic proximity sensors, which allows for alternate transmission and reception of sound waves. The sonic waves emitted by the transducer are reflected by an object and received back in the transducer. After having emitted the sound waves, the ultrasonic sensor will switch to receive mode. The time elapsed between emitting and receiving is proportional to the distance of the object from the sensor. Ultrasonic sensors generate high-frequency sound waves and evaluate the echo that is received back by the sensor, measuring the time interval between sending the signal and receiving the echo to determine the distance to an object.

# GSM Module

GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications, originally Groupe Special Mobile), is a standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the protocols for second-generation (2G) digital and Cellular networks used by mobile phones, first deployed in Finland in July 1991. As of 2014, it has become the default global standard for mobile communications – with over 90% market share, operating in over 219 countries and territories. 

GSM is a mobile communication modem; it stands for global system for mobile communication (GSM). The idea of GSM was developed at Bell Laboratories in 1970.  It is a widely used mobile communication system in the world. GSM is an open and digital cellular technology used for transmitting mobile voice and data services operating at the 850MHz, 900MHz, 1800MHz, and 1900MHz frequency bands. GSM system was developed as a digital system using the time division multiple access (TDMA) technique for communication purposes. A GSM digitizes and reduces the data, then sends it down through a channel with two different streams of client data, each in its particular time slot. The digital system can carry 64 kbps to 120 Mbps of data rates.
